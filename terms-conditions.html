        <p>Either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in court to prevent irreparable harm (e.g., intellectual property violations, security breaches).</p>

        <h3>Opt-Out</h3>
        <p>You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by sending written notice to legal@collagendirect.health within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. Opt-out does not affect other provisions of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes not subject to arbitration shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Texas, and you consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

        <h2>16. Modification of Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we make material changes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We will post the updated Terms with a new "Last Updated" date</li>
          <li>We will notify registered users via email or Platform notification</li>
          <li>Continued use of the Platform after changes take effect constitutes acceptance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you do not agree to updated Terms, you must stop using the Platform. For material changes affecting existing agreements (e.g., payment terms), we may require affirmative consent.</p>

        <h2>17. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. The invalid provision will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.</p>

        <h2>18. Waiver</h2>
        <p>Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or our right to enforce it in the future. Waivers must be in writing to be effective.</p>

        <h2>19. Assignment</h2>
        <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your account without our written consent. We may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. These Terms bind and benefit the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.</p>

        <h2>20. Entire Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, Electronic Communications Policy, HIPAA Business Associate Agreement, and MD DME Product and Services Agreement (if applicable), constitute the entire agreement between you and CollagenDirect regarding the Platform and supersede all prior agreements and understandings.</p>

        <h2>21. Survival</h2>
        <p>Provisions that by their nature should survive termination of these Terms shall survive, including: ownership provisions, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, dispute resolution, and governing law.</p>
