## Outreach Best Practices

### Email Outreach

- **Personalization**: Use {{physician_name}}, {{practice_name}}, {{city}}
- **Keep It Short**: 3-4 paragraphs max
- **Single CTA**: One clear call-to-action
- **Follow-up Sequence**:
  - Day 0: Initial email
  - Day 3: Followup #1 (if no response)
  - Day 7: Followup #2 (different angle)
  - Day 14: Breakup email ("Should I close your file?")

### SMS Outreach
- **Be Brief**: 160 characters max
- **Include Name**: Personalize with doctor's name
- **Clear Value**: State benefit immediately
- **Easy Response**: Make it simple to reply
- **Timing**: Send between 10am-4pm, Tuesday-Thursday

### Phone Outreach
- **Get Past Gatekeeper**: "I work with wound care physicians to help them reduce ordering time"
- **Discovery Questions**: Ask about current pain points
- **Listen More Than Talk**: 60% listening, 40% talking
- **Book Next Step**: Always end with scheduled follow-up

## Value Propositions to Emphasize

### Primary Benefits:
1. **Time Savings**: 6 hours per week freed up (20 min → 2 min per order)
2. **Extra Revenue**: $12,000+ per month from seeing 6-8 more patients
3. **Cash Flow Protection**: $36,000+ annual savings from eliminating denials
4. **Faster Delivery**: 36-72 hours vs 5-7 days

### Objection Responses:
- **"We have a supplier"**: Even if you stay with them, wouldn't it be good to have a backup for urgent cases?
- **"We're too busy"**: That's exactly why I'm calling - save 6 hours per week that goes back to patient care
- **"Send me info"**: I'd be happy to! Are you more interested in faster delivery, eliminating denials, or reducing staff time?

- **Initial Email**: Include link to ROI calculator
