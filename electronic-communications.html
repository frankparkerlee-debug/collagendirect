        <h3>d. AI-Powered Communications</h3>
        <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence Usage:</strong> CollagenDirect uses AI technologies to enhance communications and services:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chatbots and Virtual Assistants:</strong> AI-powered chat systems on our website and Provider Portal to answer questions, process orders, and provide support 24/7</li>
          <li><strong>Voice AI:</strong> Automated voice systems for phone support, appointment scheduling, and routine inquiries</li>
          <li><strong>Personalization Engines:</strong> AI algorithms that analyze your order history, preferences, and behavior to provide personalized product recommendations and tailored content</li>
          <li><strong>Predictive Communications:</strong> AI-driven reorder reminders based on your usage patterns, anticipated refill dates, and wound healing timelines</li>
          <li><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong> AI that interprets your messages, emails, and chat inquiries to route requests appropriately and provide relevant responses</li>
          <li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> AI-assisted creation of educational materials, product descriptions, and communication templates (always reviewed by humans for medical accuracy)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Human Oversight:</strong> While AI enhances efficiency, human healthcare professionals and support staff oversee critical decisions, review AI-generated content for accuracy, and are available when AI cannot adequately address your needs. You can always request to speak with a human representative.</p>

        <p><strong>Data Used by AI:</strong> AI systems may analyze:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Order history and product usage patterns</li>
          <li>Communication preferences and engagement metrics</li>
          <li>Support inquiries and resolution outcomes</li>
          <li>Website and portal browsing behavior</li>
          <li>Anonymized aggregate data from other users (to improve recommendations)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>AI Limitations:</strong> Our AI systems are designed to assist, not replace, human judgment. AI may:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide general information but cannot diagnose conditions or prescribe treatments</li>
          <li>Make errors or misinterpret complex inquiries</li>
          <li>Require escalation to human staff for sensitive or complex matters</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Managing Your Communication Preferences</h2>

        <h3>Opt-Out Methods</h3>
        <p><strong>SMS Text Messages:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reply <strong>STOP</strong> to any text message to opt out of all SMS communications</li>
          <li>Reply <strong>HELP</strong> for assistance</li>
          <li>You will receive one final confirmation message after opting out</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Email:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Click the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any marketing email</li>
          <li>Log into your Provider Portal account and update email preferences</li>

        </ul>

        <p><strong>Phone Calls:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tell our representative during any call that you wish to be removed from call lists</li>
          <li>Call us at 1-800-XXX-XXXX and request removal</li>
          <li>Email donotcall@collagendirect.health</li>

          <li><strong>Processing Time:</strong> Opt-out requests are processed within 10 business days (often sooner for SMS/email)</li>
          <li><strong>Separate Consent:</strong> Opting out of one channel (e.g., SMS) does not opt you out of others (e.g., email). You must opt out of each separately.</li>
          <li><strong>Re-consent:</strong> If you opt out and later wish to receive communications again, you can opt back in through your account settings or by texting START</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Security and Privacy</h2>
        <p>We implement security measures to protect electronic communications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Emails containing sensitive information are encrypted using TLS. Patient PHI is transmitted via HIPAA-compliant secure channels.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure Authentication:</strong> SMS verification codes and two-factor authentication protect account access</li>
          <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Only authorized personnel have access to communication systems and customer contact information</li>
          <li><strong>AI Data Protection:</strong> AI systems process data in secure environments with strict access controls. AI models are trained on de-identified data where possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-Party Vendors:</strong> SMS/email service providers (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid) are contractually obligated to protect your information</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Risks of Electronic Communications:</strong> While we use security measures, electronic communications are not completely secure. Email and SMS can be intercepted, lost, or misdirected. Do not include highly sensitive information (like credit card numbers) in email or SMS messages to us.</p>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Communication Providers</h2>
        <p>We use trusted third-party services to deliver communications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SMS:</strong> Twilio, Bandwidth, or similar SMS gateway providers</li>
          <li><strong>Email:</strong> SendGrid, Mailgun, or similar email service providers</li>
          <li><strong>Phone:</strong> VoIP providers and call center platforms</li>
