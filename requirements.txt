# No external Python dependencies are required for the repository's included scripts/tests.
# The Python test under `portal/test_order_flow.py` uses only the standard library (sqlite3, os, secrets, datetime).
# This file exists to satisfy platforms (like Render) that look for a requirements.txt for Python services.

# If you later add Python packages, list them here, one per line, e.g.:
# requests==2.31.0
